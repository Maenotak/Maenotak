- 👋 Hi, I’m @Maenotak
- 👀 I’m interested in everything that I think attracts my curiosity and invites my interest to learn about it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming and creating applications that aim to make my personal activities easier (hopefully it also makes things easier for other people).
- 💞️ I hope someone will guide and provide input or teach me, in doing something about what I am learning and building
- 📫 How to reach me
